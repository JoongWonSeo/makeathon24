The first generation, known as C140 from 1992 to 1998, offered models like the 500 SEC to CL500, featuring V8 and V12 engines. The second generation (C215; 1998–2006) based on the S-Class platform, introduced options such as V8, V12, and AMG engines, and innovations like the Active Body Control suspension. The third generation (C216; 2006–2014) continued this legacy with models equipped with cutting-edge features like Distronic Plus cruise control and Active NightVision. Each iteration of the CL-Class pushed boundaries in terms of luxury, design, and technological enhancements in the grand tourer segment, culminating in its successor, the S-Class Coupe.\n"
